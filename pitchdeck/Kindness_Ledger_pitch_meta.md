## Slide 1  Kindness Ledger
A simple public memory for acts of kindness.

## Slide 2  Why this matters
People help every day but those moments fade from view. Social feeds reward conflict and outrage. Communities need a calm shared memory that lifts up helpful action.

## Slide 3  A short human story
Someone helps a neighbor carry groceries. They add a short note and a picture with consent. A week later the neighbor points to the same note to say thank you. Others see it and feel encouraged to do something similar.

## Slide 4  What it is in plain words
A tiny public notebook for helpful acts. Neutral and open. Easy to understand and easy to share. People never pay fees. The project is built to be copied and used by many groups.

## Slide 5  How it feels to use
You open a calm feed and a simple map. You see kind acts near you and from places you care about. You add your own act in a few simple steps with clear consent choices. You can share gently into spaces you already use.

## Slide 6  Trust and safety
Consent first always. Use your real name, a pseudonym or stay private. Location is coarse by default. There is a clear removal path and visible community guidelines. Anyone can check that records are consistent over time.

## Slide 7  Value and goals
For people recognition and gentle inspiration. For communities visible progress and a shared sense of care. Early goals are one hundred real acts with consent, under two minutes to understand an act from the provided links, and two partners who run a kindness challenge.

## Slide 8  Next steps after acceptance
First public proofs, a small guide for communities and open examples that others can copy. Then a simple pilot with a few local groups. The long term vision is a steady current of care that balances the daily negativity on social media.
