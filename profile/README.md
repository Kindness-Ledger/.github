# Kindness Ledger

## Vision
A global stream of kindness that people can see, trust, and join. Acts of kindness gain a lasting memory, appear on a real time map, and flow into a curated AI feed that lifts attention toward care and cooperation. The platform is designed to inspire people to take similar actions in their own way and at their own pace.

## Why now
Daily feeds often pull attention toward fear and outrage. We create a visible current of care that people can follow. Hope deserves clear signals and simple ways to join.

## How it works
Each act becomes a small attestation on chain that references content addressed media. The open schema keeps proofs portable and easy to reuse. A public index powers the map and the AI feed. End users never pay fees.

## For people and communities
See kindness near you, share your own act across your social platforms, and invite your circle to join. Communities and schools can run local challenges, track participation with open signals, and celebrate stories together.

## For brands and sponsors
Fund challenges that invite real action. Earn a transparent Kindness Score from public open signals rather than private profiles. Activate on International Kindness Day and beyond with simple and respectful tools.

## Open core
Core technology is open. Specs, smart contracts, SDKs, a reference app, and a public index live in the open so anyone can reuse and build upon them.

## Repositories in this organization
- `esp_eas_sdk`  open EAS schema, TypeScript SDK, example contracts, demo, docs
- `filecoin_media_pipeline`  upload and replication pipeline with IPFS and Filecoin, retrieval path for the map and feed

## Quick start for developers
- Clone the repositories you need
- Read the README and run the quick start commands
- Open issues for questions and ideas
- Follow the public roadmap and join community calls

## Tone and care
We avoid pressure and performance. People can contribute privately, with pseudonyms, or in public. Consent and dignity come first, and the feed favors care and usefulness over spectacle.
